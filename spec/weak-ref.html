  <h1> WeakRef Objects </h1>
  <p>
    A WeakRef is an object that is used to refer to a target object
    without preserving it from garbage collection. WeakRefs can
    be dereferenced to allow access to the target object, if the target
    object hasn't been reclaimed by garbage collection.

        is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the value
        in an `extends` clause of a class definition. Subclass
        constructors that intend to inherit the specified `WeakRef`
        behaviour must include a `super` call to the `WeakRef` constructor
        to create and initialize the subclass instance with the internal
        state necessary to support the `WeakRef.prototype` built-in
        methods.

        If the WeakRef returns a _target_ Object that is not
        *undefined*, then this _target_ object should not be garbage
        collected in that turn. The KeepDuringJob operation makes sure
        read consistency is maintained.
