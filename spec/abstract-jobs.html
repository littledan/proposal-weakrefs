    object during current RunJobs algorithm/since the last microtask checkpoint,
    the implementation MAY replace the reference to the object in all such
    [[Target]] fields or internal slots with the value ~empty~.

      When the abstract operation
      KeepDuringJob is called with a target object reference, it adds the
      target to an identity Set that will point strongly at the target until
      the end of the current Job. This may be abstractly implemented as a
      Set in the current Job that becomes unreachable when the Job ends
      because the Job becomes unreachable, or as a Set in the current Agent
      that gets cleared at the end of each Job.
